This repository contains the documentation and code for the Bonsai project backend data storage. It is a work in progress, with deliverables aimed for March 29th 2019 as part of the Bonsai Hackathon.

# Triple-store choice
A decision was taken (_can someone link to this?_) before the hackathon to use **Apache Jena**. This is the [third-most-popular](https://db-engines.com/en/ranking/rdf+store) RDF store, and second-most popular open-source option, after Virtuoso.

# About Jena
Apache Jena [is a framework](https://jena.apache.org/getting_started/index.html). It uses the TDB storage engine by default.
