__01 Is the flow $x$ a determining product for the activity $y$__

Since flow here is a product, I translated it into flow-object. Also, I reread and the flow $x$ and the activity $y$ seems to be a constant. In which case this is a true or false statement.

Is the flow of steel a determining product for steel production?
Here x is "steel" and y is "steel production".

```sparql
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX b: <http://ontology.bonsai.uno/core#>

SELECT ?z WHERE {

    # exists checks if the query returns any result
    bind ( exists{ 
    
    # ?xFlow refers to the actual activity since 'x' would be the label used.
    # y is the activity which is easy enough to identify using regular language
    # x here should be translated to the flow from above, though I think in terms
    # of questions, x would be a flow object, so it's referenced as one here.
        ?xFlow b:outputOf ?yActivity; 
               ^b:determiningFlow ?yActivity; #made a mistake in domain and ranges so put an inverse ^ here.
               b:objectType ?xObject;
               
    #last two lines are for the labels which are presumed to used in the question
        ?xObject rdfs:label "steel". 
        ?yActivity rdfs:label "steel production"
        
    #output of exists returned as ?z
    } as ?z) 
}
```

---
 

__02 Is input flow $x$ required for activity $y$?__
 
This is the same query as above except that the output has been changed to input. To make the query reasonable, I changed the values of x and y.
 
Is the flow of steel a determining product for steel production?
Here x is "iron" and y is "steel production".

```sparql
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX b: <http://ontology.bonsai.uno/core#>

SELECT ?z WHERE {

    # exists checks if the query returns any result
    bind ( exists{ 
    
    # ?xFlow refers to the actual activity since 'x' would be the label used.
    # y is the activity which is easy enough to identify using regular language
    # x here should be translated to the flow from above, though I think in terms
    # of questions, x would be a flow object, so it's referenced as one here.
        ?xFlow b:outputOf ?yActivity; 
               ^b:determiningFlow ?yActivity; #made a mistake in domain and ranges so put an inverse ^ here.
               b:objectType ?xObject;
               
    #last two lines are for the labels which are presumed to used in the question
        ?xObject rdfs:label "iron". 
        ?yActivity rdfs:label "steel production"
        
    #output of exists returned as ?z
    } as ?z) 
}
```

__03 What is the amount of flow $x$ emitted as output during the time period $y$ ?__
 
I think $y$ here would be expressed as a lower $low$ bound and an upper $up$ bound. What do we do if we don’t have the actual data but we have to aggregate data in the database?

What is the amount of CO2 emitted as output on 2011?
Here x is CO2 and y is between January 1, 2011 0:00:00 and December 31, 2011 11:59:59, but we did mention that we have 2011 in our data. So in this case, I assumed that this 2011 is a properly defined time:ProperInterval that is bound as I mentioned earlier. Also, I'll put in a version wherein the proper interval isn't defined as another query.

```sparql
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX b: <http://ontology.bonsai.uno/core#>
PREFIX time: <http://www.w3.org/2006/time#>

SELECT SUM(?n) ?u WHERE {

    # This set of statements identifies the flow-object that is used for CO2.
    ?xObject a b:flow-object;
       rdfs:label "CO2".

    # ?xFlow identifies all the flows that have the ?xObject above, "CO2," as an
    # b:objectType. Since we want an amount, we want to add any units, ?u, that we
    # can as well as the value of the flow, ?n. Those that have the same units are
    # then added together.
    ?xFlow a b:flow; 
       b:objectType ?xObject;
       b:hasUnit ?u;
       b:hasNumericValue ?n;
       b:hasTemporalExtent <http://rdf.bonsai.uno/time/2011>;
       b:outputOf ?a
}

# group by is to ensure only those that have the same units are added.
GROUP BY ?u
```

limits defined

What is the amount of CO2 emitted as output on June 2011?

This should probably be modified to include a range of dates instead of something that fits the interval exactly. So if I'm looking for data on June 2011. I can still pull data that was generated from June 15 - June 20, 2011. Not sure though if the ranges intersect.

__04 What is the location of the agent performing the activity $y$?__

```sparql
PREFIX b: <http://ontology.bonsai.uno/core#>

SELECT ?a ?loc WHERE {
    ?a b:performs y;
       a agent;
       b:location ?loc
}
```

---

__05 What other agents performing the same type of activity of agent $z$ are present in the same location $w$?__
 
The other agents I called $a$ and here z is a constant instead of a variable in sparql so I’ll leave it as a z. I also removed z from the result set since this is a given.

```sparql
PREFIX b: <http://ontology.bonsai.uno/core#>

SELECT ?a WHERE {
    z a b:agent;
      b:performs ?w;
      b:location ?l.
    ?y b:performs ?w;
       b:location ?l.
    MINUS { z }
}
```

__06 How are the flow objects quantified? / Which units of measure are used?__

```sparql
PREFIX b: <http://ontology.bonsai.uno/core#>
PREFIX om: <http://www.ontology-of-units-of-measure.org/resource/om-2/>

SELECT ?x ?unit WHERE {
    ?x a b:flowObject.
    ?z a b:flow;
       b:objectType ?x;
       om:hasUnit ?unit
}
```

---

__07 Does the input and output of flow objects follow mass balance?__
 
I’m assuming this flow objects mass balance is from flows. Also, this only works for same unit scales.

```
TBD
```

---

__08 Further, balance checks on ALL flows of a specific flow-object across all activities, requires a more complete database.__

Similar question to above except we're looking into all flows into all activities.

---
 
__09 Is output flow required for activity of type 'stock'?__
 
Are we still handling stocks? Not sure how to query this as stocks was mentioned to be outside the ontology.
 
---

__10 What is the direct input flow of flow-object F to activity A measured by flow-property P in location L in the time period T under macro-economic scenario S?__
 
I think flow-property here is redundant since we already standardized the units. So I’m removing it from the query itself. Still need to consider convertion. Don't know how to ask the about the macro-economic scenario though.

```sparql
PREFIX b: <http://ontology.bonsai.uno/core#>
PREFIX om: <http://www.ontology-of-units-of-measure.org/resource/om-2/>
PREFIX time: <http://www.w3.org/2006/time#>

SELECT sum(?v) ?u WHERE {
    ?i a flow;
       om:hasValue ?v;
       b:objectType ?f;
       b:inputOf ?a;
       om:hasUnit ?u.
    ?a a activity;
       b:location l;
       b:hasTemporalExtent ?t.
    ?t a time:ProperInterval;
       time:hasBeginning low;
       time:hasEnd up
}
GROUP BY ?u
```

__11 What is the direct output flow of flow-object F from activity A measured by flow-property P in location L in the time period T under macro-economic scenario S?__
 
Same comments as above. Also similar query with only the input changed to the output.

```sparql
PREFIX b: <http://ontology.bonsai.uno/core#>

       b:outputOf ?a;
       om:hasUnit ?u.
    ?a a activity;
       b:location l;
       b:hasTemporalExtent ?t.

    ?f b:determiningFlow ?a;

    ?a a b:activity;
       b:location l;
       b:hasTemporalExtent ?t.
    ?t a time:ProperInterval;
       time:hasBeginning low;

Conversion (simple multiplication)
-----

Converts simple units of measure to their SI counterparts. (Only works for length, time (not 1/time), mass, and equivalent basic units - though it might work on energy. Doesn't work for velocity, rates, power density and similar with complicated conversions). This works with the property factor in the om ontology.

SELECT ((xsd:float(?v)*xsd:float(?f)) as ?result)
WHERE {

  # What is needed is both the value, ?v, of the flow that is being calculated.
  # Here ?s is a measure since b:Flow is a subclass of om2:Measure.
  # We also need the unit so we know if we need to convert.
  ?s a om2:Measure;
     om2:hasUnit ?u;
     om2:hasNumericalValue ?v.
     
  # In the om ontology, the units have a conversion factor to SI if necessary.
  # This is referenced by the data-property om2:hasFactor and is stored in ?f.
  ?u om2:hasFactor ?f

Property Path -> Activity Lists
----

Property path assumes the same pathway across recursive properties. This is the example for tracing "Coal" and works with the "simple_steel_transport" in the <https://github.com/BONSAMURAIS/BONSAI-ontology-RDF-framework/blob/master/examples/simple_steel_transport.rdf>.

Property paths are defined in <https://www.w3.org/2009/sparql/wiki/Feature:PropertyPaths>.
